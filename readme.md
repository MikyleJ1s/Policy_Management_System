Basic HTML and CSS implementation of our UI.

The html already has references to the fields 
username field reference is "Username"
password field reference is "Password"

The CSS file is messy it is a mish mesh of things I've learned fueled by hours of Kendrick, Atmosphere and many many cups of tea.
