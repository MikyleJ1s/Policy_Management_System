Basic HTML and CSS implementation of our UI.

The html already has references to the fields 
username field reference is "Username"
password field reference is "Password"

The CSS file is messy it is a mish mesh of things I've learned fueled by hours of Kendrick, Atmosphere and many many cups of tea.

Known bugs = Will not work with dark reader.



Reimplemented login backend
In order to load your users in your database just set the connection parameters and change the column names and SQL query for only username and password for performance.
